.. _install_linux-label:

The process is exactly the same as 
`installing anaconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html>`_
or `miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install>`_:

1. In your terminal window, run:

   ..  code-block:: bash
    
       bash HyperSpy-bundle-YYYY.MM.DD-Linux-x86_64.sh

2. Follow the prompts on the installer screens.
   If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change
   them later.
3. To make the changes take effect, close and then re-open your terminal window.
4. Test your installation. In your terminal window, run the command 
   ``conda list``. A list of installed packages appears if it has been
   installed correctly.


And that's it! All the installed programs should now be installed and they
distribution should be available from the terminal or from the context menu
(:ref:`usage-label`).

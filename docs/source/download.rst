If you are brand new to Python, the easiest way to install HyperSpy is using
the "standalone" bundle package. This simple to install program provides a
customized Python installation that has the HyperSpy libraries pre-installed.
It is compatible with Windows, MacOS, or Linux, and is the recommended way
to install if you are not familiar with managing Python environments.

First, navigate to the repository home page
(https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-bundle), and click on the large green
button slightly down the page:

   Clicking the big green button on the main repository page will bring you to
   the "Releases" page that contains a link to the ``.exe`` installation file

On the releases page, click on the appropriate installer for your system. There
are a few options, but we recommend either the one labeled "Intel" or 
"AMD" depending on what type of processor your computer has, since those 
versions are optimized for each type of processor. These bundles are based
off of the "Anaconda" Python distribution:

   Select one of either Intel or AMD depending on what type of processor is in
   your computer. If you use Linux or Mac, select the appropriate file for your
   system (although we only show a Windows installation here).

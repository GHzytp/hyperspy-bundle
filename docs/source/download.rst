If you are brand new to Python, the easiest way to install HyperSpy is using
the "standalone" bundle package. This simple to install program provides a
customized Python installation that has the HyperSpy libraries pre-installed.
It is compatible with Windows, MacOS, or Linux, and is the recommended way
to install if you are not familiar with managing Python environments.

After the download finishes, run the ``.exe`` file, accepting the default options.
Doing so will install HyperSpy into the folder you choose under a subfolder named
``hyperspy-bundle``. Depending on your system, the installation may take quite some 
time (especially on the "Setting up the package cache..." and 
"Setting up the base environment..." steps), but you should get a progress 
window that looks like:

Once the installation eventually finishes, click the *Next* button, and then 
*Finish* to exit the installer. 

And that's it! You should now have a few new applications in your
Start Menu, including the "HyperSpy Prompt" and "HyperSpyUI".
